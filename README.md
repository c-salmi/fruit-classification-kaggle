# Fruit Classification Kaggle Challenge

To sharpen my computer vision engineering skills, I have taken up a small kaggle challenge. The fruit dataset consists of 101 classes of fruits. Each class has around 400 images for the training set, 50 for validation set and finally 50 for the test set.

## Methodology

Before getting started with any machine learning methods, I first want to understand the data better to make informed decision about what technique to use and why.

My **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) can be found in the `notebooks/eda.ipynb` jupyter notebook.
